We are a community of believers passionate about sharing the love of Jesus Christ and helping people discover their purpose in Him.\r\n\r\nMy wife Chelsea and I feel honored and blessed to serve as pastors of this incredible church family. We moved here in 2023 with a vision to build a church where everyone feels welcome, loved, and valued.\r\n\r\nAt River of Life, we believe that church should be a place where life begins - where you can find hope, healing, and a fresh start no matter where you've been or what you've been through.\r\n\r\nWhether you're exploring faith for the first time, returning after time away, or looking for a new church home, we'd love to meet you. Our doors are always open, and there's a place here for you.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to join us for a service and experience the warmth and love of our church family. We truly believe that your best days are ahead!",
